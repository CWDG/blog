# Autumn 2015
*Written by Jonathan Arnett (J3RN)*

You may have wondered "Since CWDG changes every semester, what are we doing this semester?" Fortunately, I am here to tell you.

Firstly, if you *really* care about all the nitty-gritty details of the club, I'd advise you to check out the [Autumn 2015 Semester Guide](https://github.com/CWDG/semester-plans/blob/master/2015-08/guide.md), which I have been writing since a long-long-time-ago. If you just want a brief overview covering all the changes between the coming semester and the last, read on.

### Talks

Talks. They've been a fundamental part of CWDG since it's inception (I think, I wasn't actually there). Anyhow, over my time as president, talks have fallen by the wayside in favor of hands-on learning. What I failed to realize when I made this change was the number of people who were interested in web development, but could not spare the time to continue working on projects on their own.

To compensate for this, talks are resuming their place as one of the cornerstones of the club. This semester, we will be hosting a talk at the beginning of every meeting. The talks that we've planned cover, in a sensible order, a set of web technologies from HTML up to Ruby on Rails. My hope is to have speakers from the community, as well as several from within our own numbers, deliver these talks. It is also my hope that members that are too busy to work on projects will still learn a lot from following along with the talks.

### Projects

Projects this coming semester are not going to be club websites. As a matter of fact, the projects will not be specified from powers upon high at all. **Instead, the projects for this semester will be member-sourced, hackathon-style**. Do you have a cool web app idea that you'd like to work on with some other folks? Bring it! The first two meetings will be socializing and team-building oriented to give you time to build your team, and teams will be officially formed at the third meeting.

This semester, we'd like to get the Columbus web development community involved to help teams with their projects. Ideally, volunteers would mix and mingle with different teams, offering up expertise. Also, this semester projects will be judged by more than just the rest of the club. As I write this, I am assembling a panel of judges who will choose the top three teams and award prizes. The prizes are, at this time, undecided (but they will be soon, so stay posted).

### Summary

To wrap up, we're doing more talks, better talks, and talks that are more beginner-oriented to help get newbies on their way. Also, we're treating projects more like a semester-long hackathon this semester, without MLH, bad food, or being sleepless. My hope is that this semester will be our best semseter yet, and I hope that you are as excited as I am about what lies ahead.
