# Autumn 2015
*Written by Jonathan Arnett (J3RN)*

You may have wondered "Since CWDG changes every semester, what are we doing this semester?" Fortunately, I am here to tell you.

Firstly, if you *really* care about all the nitty-gritty details of the club, I'd advise you to check out the [Autumn 2015 Semester Guide](https://github.com/CWDG/semester-plans/blob/master/2015-08/guide.md), which I have been writing since a long-long-time-ago. If you just want a brief overview covering all the changes between the coming semester and the last, read on.

### Talks

Talks. They've been a fundamental part of CWDG since it's inception (I think, I wasn't actually there). Anyhow, over my time as president, talks have fallen by the wayside in favor of hands-on learning. What I failed to realize when I made this change was the number of people who were interested in web development, but could not spare the time to continue working on projects on their own.

To compensate for this, talks are resuming their place as one of the cornerstones of the club. This semester, we will be hosting a talk at the beginning of every meeting. The talks that we've planned cover, in a sensible order, a set of web technologies from HTML up to Ruby on Rails. My hope is to have speakers from the community, as well as several from within our own numbers, deliver these talks. It is also my hope that members that are too busy to work on projects will still learn a lot from following along with the talks.

### Projects / Exercises

For the Autumn 2015 semester, projects are being put on hold. Instead of projects, member's will have the option to complete exercises related to the talk each week. Ideally, these projects should at least be started at the end of the meeting, when people such as myself are available to help out where needed. Of course, these exercises are, as I mentioned, optional. My hope is that even students who do not have the time to complete the exercises (or projects in previous semesters) will still be able to gain a reasonable amount of knowledge about web development from the talks alone, and will be inclined to come back.

### Summary

To wrap up, we're doing more talks, better talks, and talks that are more beginner-oriented to help get newbies on their way. Also, we're ditching project, and, instead, doing small exercises. My hope is that this semester will be our best semseter yet, and I hope that you are as excited as I am about what lies ahead.
